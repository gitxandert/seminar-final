# seminar-final

Final project for Seminar in Computer Music at Indiana University, Jacobs School of Music.

This project demonstrates some capabilities of RNBO, a Max MSP package that allows for exports of Max-like patches to the web.

This project also uses p5 to generate graphics with variables coming out of the RNBO patch.
